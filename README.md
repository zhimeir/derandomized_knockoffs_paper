# derandomized_knockoffs_paper
A repository to reproduce the numerical results in the [Derandomized Knockoffs]() paper. 

## Overview
We provide the code to <em>exactly</em> reproduce the numerical results in Section 3-5 of the paper. Based on the  code,
we additionally develop an R package `derandomKnock`, which will be constantly improved and udpated. We recommend the users to check
out the R package unless their aim is to reproduce the examples of our paper.

## Folders
- `R`: contains the code the implement the variable selection proceduresã€‚
- `simulations`: contains the scripts the carry out the simulations.
- `results`: stores the result.
