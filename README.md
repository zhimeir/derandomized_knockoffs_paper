# derandomized_knockoffs_paper
A repository to reproduce the numerical results in the [Derandomized Knockoffs]() paper. 

## Overview
We provide the code to <em>exactly</em> reproduce the numerical results in Section 3-5 of the paper. Based on the  code,
we develop an R package `derandomKnock`, which will be constantly improved and udpated. We recommend the uses to check
out the R package unless their aim is to reproduce the examples of our paper.
